Housekeeping:
	Move all code in the "public" schema into project-specific schemata.

Features:
	Get dependency tree for views and materialized views.
	Rebase a view.
	Destroy and re-create a view tree.
	Refresh a materialized view tree in dependency order.
	View which gives information on partitions.

Fixes:
	Modify find_in_path() to take either a single argument (the object),
	or two arguments (the schema and the object).  While it seems
	pointless to look for something if you already know where it is,
	this would allow the function to be used to find out if a particular
	thing exists in a particular place.  A null result means, "no".
